# Group-B2 
For the presentation of the Final Project Demo for the Introduction to Robotics Class, we will be performing these three tasks:
Task I: Pick and Place

In the first task we perform the Pick and Place exercise with the EPSON Robot. It consists of picking up tokens and blocks from a feeder, alligning them with the allignment fixture, and placing them in the tray.

Task II: Stacking
For the second task we have the Stacking exercise, which as the name states, it consists of stacking 6 tokens and 6 blocks intervariated.

Task III: Custom exercise
